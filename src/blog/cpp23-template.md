# Revolutionize Your Competitive Programming Workflow with the Universal C++23 Template

Repo: https://github.com/jaipkapoor99/CP-Template

## My Vision: AI and Software Engineering in CP

Beyond just a template, my goal is to bring the power of AI assistance and robust software engineering principles to the competitive programming world. Imagine a future where AI tools can help you quickly scaffold solutions, identify common pitfalls, or even suggest optimal algorithms based on problem constraints. This template is a step towards that vision, emphasizing clean code, modularity, and comprehensive testing ‚Äì practices that are fundamental to good software engineering.

**A Crucial Disclaimer:** While I advocate for the use of AI to enhance learning and productivity in competitive programming *preparation*, I **do NOT condone or support the use of AI assistance during live contests or any graded assessments.** The integrity of competitive programming relies on individual problem-solving skills.

Competitive programming demands efficiency, speed, and robust debugging. While many templates exist, few offer a truly modern, streamlined, and visually rich experience tailored for today's competitive landscape. Introducing the **Universal C++23 Competitive Programming Template** ‚Äì designed to elevate your problem-solving workflow on Unix-like systems.

## üåü Key Features That Set This Template Apart

This template isn't just a collection of algorithms; it's a comprehensive environment built for competitive programmers by competitive programmers.

### ‚ö° C++23 Compatibility: Stay Ahead of the Curve

Embrace the latest C++ standard with confidence. This template is built with C++23 in mind, ensuring you can leverage modern language features and library additions. It includes smart header inclusion with fallbacks for older compilers, providing flexibility while pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

### üé® Enhanced Colorful Debug System: Debugging Reimagined

Gone are the days of tedious `cout` debugging. Our template features a professional-grade, visually stunning debug system that transforms your terminal into a powerful diagnostic tool:

* **Visual Debug Output**: `DEBUG()` macros provide beautifully boxed output with timestamps and location info, making it easy to pinpoint issues.
* **Performance & Progress**: Accurately measure execution times with `TIMER_START/END()` and track long-running operations with visual `PROGRESS()` bars.
* **Rich Data Visualization**: Containers, pairs, and complex data structures are formatted with vibrant colors, making data inspection intuitive and efficient.
* **Enhanced Assertions**: `ASSERT()` macros provide dramatic visual failure displays, immediately drawing your attention to critical errors.

### üöÄ Streamlined Unix-like Experience: Focus on What Matters

Built specifically for Linux, macOS, and WSL environments, this template offers a clean, focused experience. We've removed all Windows-specific components and simplified the script structure. All essential automation scripts (`attach.sh`, `cleanup.sh`, `detach.sh`, `test.sh`) are now directly accessible in the `scripts/` directory, ensuring a seamless and native feel on your preferred Unix-like system.

### üí° Modular Design & Zero Overhead in Contest Mode

The template boasts a clean, modular design, separating core utilities from the debug system. Crucially, all debug features compile to no-ops in contest mode. This means you get all the powerful debugging capabilities during development without any performance overhead when you submit your solution.

### üß™ Advanced Testing Features: Build Confidence in Your Solutions

Beyond basic compilation, the template provides robust testing utilities:

* **Stress Testing with Brute Force Comparison**: Automatically generate random test cases, run your main solution against a simpler brute-force implementation, and quickly identify discrepancies.
* **Customizable Test Generation**: Use inline generators or integrate Python scripts for complex input patterns.

## ü§î Why Choose This Template?

* **Boost Productivity**: Spend less time debugging and more time solving problems with an intuitive and powerful debug system.
* **Stay Modern**: Leverage the latest C++ features for cleaner, more efficient code.
* **Seamless Workflow**: Enjoy a consistent and optimized development environment across all Unix-like platforms.
* **Confidence in Submissions**: Ensure your code is performant and correct with zero overhead and advanced testing.
