# Embracing Monorepos with pnpm Workspaces: A Journey Towards Streamlined Development

Repo: https://github.com/jaipkapoor99/PNPM-Demo

This document outlines my experience in establishing a monorepository structure utilizing pnpm workspaces. For developers managing interconnected projects, the challenges of maintaining separate repositories can be significant. These often include redundant dependencies across projects, disparate development environments that complicate consistency, and intricate deployment procedures for interdependent components. Monorepos, particularly when integrated with efficient tools like pnpm, offer a compelling solution to these complexities by centralizing development and streamlining workflows.

## Why pnpm Workspaces?

Prior to detailing the implementation process, it is beneficial to understand the rationale behind adopting this approach. For projects such as "PNPM-Demo," which encompasses distinct components like an administrative application, a user-facing application, and a shared user interface library, a monorepository structure presented itself as a highly advantageous architectural choice. The selection of pnpm as the package manager for this setup was driven by several key benefits:

1. **Efficient Dependency Management:** pnpm significantly optimizes dependency handling. Instead of duplicating `node_modules` directories across every package, pnpm employs a content-addressable store to create links to dependencies. This methodology results in notably faster installation times, reduced disk space consumption, and a more organized project directory.
2. **Enhanced Strictness:** In contrast to other package managers, pnpm enforces stricter rules regarding dependency access. This characteristic helps mitigate the occurrence of "phantom dependencies"—situations where a package implicitly relies on a dependency of another package without explicitly declaring it. This leads to more robust and predictable build processes.
3. **Streamlined Setup:** The workspace configuration with pnpm is remarkably straightforward. A concise `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file at the root of the repository is sufficient to define your packages, and a simple `pnpm install` command manages the entire process, automatically linking local packages.

## My Monorepo Structure

In my "PNPM-Demo" project, the organizational structure is as follows:

```txt
PNPM-Demo/
├── packages/
│   ├── admin-app/
│   ├── user-app/
│   └── common-ui/
└── pnpm-workspace.yaml
└── package.json
```

Each directory located within `packages/` functions as an independent pnpm package. For instance, the `common-ui` library can be seamlessly integrated and utilized by both the `admin-app` and `user-app` without requiring complex publishing steps or manual linking.

## Key Utilities and Commands

Upon establishing your workspace, pnpm provides a suite of valuable utilities for effective management:

- **`pnpm install`**: Executing this command from the monorepo root will install all dependencies for every package and establish links for local packages. This process is notably efficient.
- **`pnpm -r <command>`**: This command is exceptionally useful for executing a specified command across all packages within your monorepo. For example, `pnpm -r build` will initiate the build process for every package. This capability proved invaluable for my "PNPM-Demo" project, enabling the simultaneous building of all applications and the `common-ui` library with a single command.
- **`pnpm run <script-name>`**: You can define scripts within your root `package.json` that can, in turn, execute scripts located in individual packages. For example, I have configured `dev:user` and `dev:admin` scripts to launch the development servers for their respective applications.

## A Minor Challenge (and its Resolution)

A minor challenge encountered during the initial setup involved the automatic generation of TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`) for the `common-ui` package, which was not fully functional. As a temporary measure, `shims-common-ui.d.ts` files were introduced into both the `user-app` and `admin-app`. This approach allowed development to proceed without encountering TypeScript errors related to missing type definitions, and the runtime functionality of the applications remained unaffected. This illustrates that even with robust tools, occasional adjustments may be necessary.

## The Compelling Advantages

The adoption of pnpm workspaces for my monorepository has significantly enhanced my development workflow, directly addressing the inherent difficulties of managing projects in separate repositories. It has simplified dependency management, improved build times, and fostered a consistent development environment across all interconnected applications. Furthermore, the benefits of a monorepo extend to several critical areas:

- **Facilitated Code Sharing:** Consolidating all related projects within a single repository greatly simplifies the process of sharing code and components, such as the `common-ui` library. This eliminates the need to publish packages to a registry solely for internal consumption, thereby promoting reusability and minimizing code duplication.
- **Atomic Changes:** When modifications impact multiple projects—for instance, an update to the shared UI library affecting both the administrative and user applications—all necessary adjustments can be committed as a single, cohesive unit. This practice ensures that all components of your system remain compatible, reducing integration complexities and simplifying rollback procedures.
- **Streamlined Refactoring:** Refactoring code across project boundaries is considerably more straightforward within a monorepo. Development tools can analyze the entire codebase, facilitating the identification of all affected areas and ensuring consistent application of changes.
- **Consistent Tooling and Practices:** A monorepo encourages the implementation of uniform build tools, linters, and coding standards across all projects. This reduces the cognitive load for developers, streamlines the onboarding process for new team members, and contributes to an elevated overall code quality.

- **Optimized CI/CD:** Configuring continuous integration and deployment pipelines can be more efficient within a monorepo. It is possible to establish a single pipeline to build, test, and deploy all applications, or to implement intelligent pipelines that selectively execute tests and deployments only for projects impacted by a specific change.
- **Enhanced Project Visibility:** Centralizing all related code provides a holistic perspective of your entire system. Developers can readily navigate between different applications and libraries, comprehend interdependencies, and anticipate the impact of changes in one area on others.

If you are considering a monorepository architecture, I strongly recommend exploring `pnpm`. It has proven to be a transformative tool in my development practice.
