# The Subversive Writer

A personal essay site built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

Essays that challenge the default â€” culture, creativity, work, and tech.

Notes

- Content lives in `src/blog/*.md` (first line is `# Title`, second line may be `Date: YYYY-MM-DD`).
- Run `npm run generate-blog-data` before builds to refresh `src/data/blog-posts.json`.
- Development: `npm run dev`. Production preview: `npm run preview` after `npm run build`.
