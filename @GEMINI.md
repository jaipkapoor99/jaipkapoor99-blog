## Code Style Guidelines

To maintain consistency and leverage modern JavaScript features, please adhere to the following:

- **ES6+ Features:** Utilize ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and newer features where appropriate (e.g., `const`, `let`, template literals, destructuring, spread/rest operators).
- **Arrow Functions:** Prefer arrow functions (`=>`) for anonymous functions and callbacks, especially in React components, for cleaner syntax and lexical `this` binding.
